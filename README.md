# REC v4

This repository contains RealEstateCore (REC) v4, to be released (tentatively) in late summer, 2022.

REC v4 combines the RealEstateCore and Brick Schema ontologies, covering all aspects of the Smart Building domain using established standard semantics.

We distribute REC v4 both as [SHACL shapes](Ontology/SHACL/) and as [DTDL v2](Ontology/DTDLv2/) and [DTDL v3](Ontology/DTDLv3/) models.

In addition, REC v4 includes northbound [RESTful API declarations](API/REST) in OpenAPI Specification format (formerly known as Swagger), and southbound [edge message formats](API/Edge) for communicating with building management systems.

This documentation is work in progress and will be substantially updated before final release of REC v4.
